# Practice: Promises

## Directions
Fork and clone this lab. Respond to questions in clear, concise sentences directly within this markdown file.

**1. What will the following code snippet log? Why?**
  ```javascript
  console.log('Line 1')
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Line 2'), 1000)
  console.log('Line 3')
  ```

**2. What does the following code snippet log? Why?**
  ```javascript
  function createPromise(seconds) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(function() {
        resolve(`After ${seconds} second(s), this promise is resolved.`)
      }, seconds * 1000)
    })
  }

  console.log(createPromise(1000))
  ```

**3. How do we use our `createPromise` function to log `"After 1 second(s), this promise is resolved."`**

**4. What does the following code snippet return? What does it log?**
  ```javascript
  const ouPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve(12);
  })

  ourPromise.then(value => value * 2);
  ```

**5. What does the last line of code return? What does it log?** <br> **Note: Instead of using the `Promise` constructor to create a Promise that immediately resolves to 12, we can just use the [`Promise.resolve`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) method.**
  ```javascript
  const ourPromise = Promise.resolve(12);
  ourPromise.then(value => value * 2).then(value => value + 10);
  ```

**6. What does the following code snippet return? What does it log? How does this differ from the question above?**
  ```javascript
  Promise.resolve(12).then(value => value * 2).then(value => console.log(value + 10))
  ```

**7. What does the following code snippet return? What does it log? How does this differ from the question above?**
  ```javascript
  Promise.resolve(12).then(value => value * 2).then(value => {
    console.log(value + 10);
    return value + 10;
    });
  ```

**8. What does the following code snippet return? What does it log? How does this differ from the question above?**
  ```javascript
  Promise.reject(12).then(value => value * 2).then(value => {
    console.log(value + 10);
    return value + 10;
    }).catch(reason => {
      const message = `${reason} is a bad number.`;
      console.error(message);
      return reason;
    });
  ```
